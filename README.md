## The Design and Construction of a Fuel-Efficient Urban-Concept Vehicle. 
A PROJECT SUBMITTED IN PARTIAL FULFILLMENT OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE AWARD OF BACHELOR OF SCIENCE DEGREE IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING OBAFEMI AWOLOWO UNIVERSITY ILE-IFE, NIGERIA.
The rapid increase in the price of refine petroleum products motivates various researches on the design of fuel efficient vehicles. A very important design consideration that greatly affects the fuel consumption of vehicles is the aerodynamic characteristics, which are made up of drag, lift and pressure coefficients. This project enumerated the designs of fuel efficient urban concept vehicles and thereafter conducted numerical simulation of flow around the vehicle prototype aiming at analyzing the aerodynamic behavior at different velocities. The design of the car body was carried out to meet the rules and standards of the Eco-Marathon competition organized by Shell. The numerical method involves pre-processing, processing and post-processing activities that was accomplished using ANSYS FLUENT software. The models were developed using Autodesk Inventor and was exported to Fluent where the numerical computation was carried out. The results of the simulation were obtained inform of pressure and velocity contour, drag and lift coefficients, and pressure coefficient. Model 6 has the lowest drag coefficient and is chosen as the best model for the fuel efficient urban concept vehicle.
